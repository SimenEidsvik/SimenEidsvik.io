            during a school program called Utplasserings Uke (workplacement week) i worked at Vard laying cables
            on one of their <br> ships. after finishing yrkesskule(Car Mechanic school) i started working for mekonomen(a norwegian car workshop). <br>
            i worked there 2 years and then finished my fagbrev(certificate of apprenticeship) and then i entered the army.

        <p>
            I did my f√∏rstegangstjeneste(national service) from 17th august 2020 to 16th august 2021. while there i worked on belt driven <br>
            troop transports, supply trucks and army passenger cars of type mb gl 240. After the army i found work at a car recycling <br>
            company. my job was to empty the car of oil and fuel and then search it for undamaged parts that could be re-used. <br>
            these parts were then sold to insurance companies and workshops to so that customers would save money.
